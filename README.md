# odin-recipes

## Project Overview

This is the first project of The Odin Project's Foundations Course - a simple, static website built with pure HTML. The site features a homepage that links to individual recipe pages, each containing clear and easy-to-follow instructions.

The purpose of this project is to practice the foundational elements of HTML, including:

- **Headings and paragraphs**
- **Links**
- **Lists**
- **Image embedding**

## What I Learned

- **Basic HTML document structure**  
  Understanding how to set up `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

- **Working with text in HTML**  
  Using elements like `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, etc.

- **Creating links**  
  Implementing both **absolute** (external) and **relative** (internal) links using `<a>`.

- **Embedding images**  
  Using the `<img>` tag to display images, setting `alt` text, and understanding image paths.

- **Security considerations with links and images**  
  Learning about `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links.

- **Giving proper credit to image sources**  
  Including image attributions and linking back to original sources when using third-party images.
